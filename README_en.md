## Project Introduce
This project is prepared for the GoGreen competition. It can drive a 120W solar panel and power mobile devices such as mobile phones. It can also be equipped with a weather monitoring station to provide users with weather data and news combined with network data.

This facility is mainly used in schools. The Raspberry Pi it brings can create a server in the campus LAN. Students can log in to the server and see the current weather conditions on the website.

Unlike other solar devices, this facility's solar panels can be automatically or manually aligned with the sun to achieve maximum working efficiency throughout the day, and the batteries it carries allow the facility to work day and night.
